# CCNL_EP_MEND_PLS_Psychopathology
This repository contains code and data created in support of my project "Decoding Early Psychoses: Unraveling Stable Microstructural Features Associated with Psychopathology Across Independent Cohorts". All code was written in Python. 

The code folder contains all the code used to run the analyses and generate the figures.
The data folder contains all the data used to run the analyses, including preprocessed DTI metrics from both HCP-EP and MEND datasets. If you use any of the processed DTI data, please cite this paper. The PLS outputs are not included due to file size.
